# Genetic Algorithm
# Implement a genetic algorithm which uses the NumberAlloc class to represent individuals.
# The algorithm should evolve a population of individuals and return the best individual based on the highest fitness function.
# NumberAlloc is a class which represents a number allocation problem.
# 40 numbers are divided into 4 groups of 10 numbers each, with each group having a different value.
# The fitness function is the sum of the scores of the groups.
