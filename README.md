## Introduction to Artificial Intelligence Project 2

- Matthew Hlushko
- Jacob van Steyn
- Daniel Johnson

To run the project, run main.py via the command line, with the arguments
being: 

`python main.py [problem(1 or 2)] [input_file (.txt file)] [max_runtime_seconds (float)]`

Example: `python main.py 1 input.txt 20`

Without these parameters, you will be prompted with a few questions to run the code.

To turn on and off culling and elitism, go to line 59 or 69 for problem 1
and 2 respectively, where you can change whether elitism and culling is used,
as well as population size and mutation rate.
